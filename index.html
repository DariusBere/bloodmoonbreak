                    My name is Darius-Mihai Berinde, a young adult from Romania. Always looking for new ways to keep my life interesting and active. 
                    I've started to draw from a young age, started programming at the age of 13 with my friend group making video-games in Unity, practiced 
                    MMA for several years and always had a passion for bikes and drifting. At the age of 17 I've moved to Spain. At this point, as I was apart from
                    my lifetime friends, I had to find a way to distract myself and do something with my free time, so I did what I liked most, drawing,
                    image editing and some basic programming from time to time. My drawing skills kept getting better, from basic sketches to getting 
                    really comfortable drawing fictional portraits. Life looked promising, but I never stay still in one place, so that's the way I found tattooing.

                After posting some of my digital and traditional art on my personal instagram, a friend of mine at the time got in touch with me. He was telling me 
                how he started this course for Beginner tattoo artists, and he begged me to come have a look and tell him what I think. So I did, I went to 
                one of their courses with his teacher's agreement and showed me what they were learning there. At first sight, this looked nothing close to a beginner's
                course, they were tattooing Salvador Dali's portrait on fake skin. I told my friend all amazed "There is no way I could do that!". The next second I have
                his professor right behind me, I've been dared to try. Without much fate I still tried, I had nothing to lose, but something happened that moment, it clicked 
                instantly. To be honest, I did not have the greatest portrait of Dali in the classroom, but it felt like I've unlocked a new passion that was already fueled 
                by my love for art. After that day, I took the course myself and started doing progressively harder tattoos as time passed on. A very big help to starting this journey 
                were my friends that had faith in me to do my first ever tattoos on their skin.

                    At first finding your style is not easy at all, you might have a style that you like to look at, but does not directly apply to the style you
                    like to tattoo. When you start tattooing you start with easy designs that the clients come with, or the ones you have already sketched. A very
                    important factor is to know your skill level and do not overshoot, there are no shortcuts to getting better and doing more complicated pieces other 
                    than practice and getting hours on the clock with the machine in your hand. With all of that said, I still consider myself closer to a beginner than
                    a master, but the styles that I enjoy doing the most so far are anime, neo-traditional, and when the clients are on board with me making the design based
                    on their wishes and my skill level. I had the great honor to tattoo 2 of my designs for a client themed around northern mythology from scratch 
                    (the pictures on the right), with complete freedom and no reference, just some elements and details that I had to include to meet the clients ideal. 
                    Some styles that I would like to try in the future are new school, trash polka, horimono and wabori (japanese tattoos) and watercolor. Basically introducing 
                    color into my tattoos and giving them more life over all.

                    BloodMoonBreak started as a gamer tag that I used along the years. The first time that I used this pseudonym in was League of Legends and it was 
                    inspired by the skin set Blood Moon. I was already obsessed with the moon and it's beauty, so it fitted right in. As time passed by, the total 
                    lunar eclipse obtained some meaning. For it symbolizes that even the moon bleeds sometimes, but we do heal and keep going, we have to enjoy our time on this floating rock
                    in this grand universe to the fullest, even if we "bleed" sometimes.
